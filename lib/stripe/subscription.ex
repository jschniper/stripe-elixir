  ## Attributes
  
  - `id` - string 
  - `object` - string, value is "subscription" 
  - `cancel_at_period_end` - boolean - If the subscription has been 
      canceled with the at_period_end flag set to true, 
      cancel_at_period_end on the subscription will be true. You can use 
      this attribute to determine whether a subscription that has a 
      status of active is scheduled to be canceled at the end of the 
      current period.
  - `customer` - string  
  - `plan` - hash, plan object - Hash describing the plan the customer 
      is subscribed to
  - `quantity` - integer 
  - `start` - timestamp - Date the subscription started
  - `status` - string - Possible values are trialing, active, past_due, 
      canceled, or unpaid. A subscription still in its trial period is 
      trialing and moves to active when the trial period is over. When 
      payment to renew the subscription fails, the subscription becomes 
      past_due. After Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts, 
      the subscription ends up with a status of either canceled or 
      unpaid depending on your retry settings. Note that when a 
      subscription has a status of unpaid, no subsequent invoices will 
      be attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately 
      automatically closed). After receiving updated card details from a 
      customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices.
  - `application_fee_percent` - decimal - A positive decimal that 
      represents the fee percentage of the subscription invoice amount 
      that will be transferred to the application ownerâ€™s Stripe account 
      each billing period.
  - `canceled_at` - timestamp - If the subscription has been canceled, 
      the date of that cancellation. If the subscription was canceled 
      with cancel_at_period_end, canceled_at will still reflect the date 
      of the initial cancellation request, not the end of the 
      subscription period when the subscription is automatically moved 
      to a canceled state.
  - `current_period_end` - timestamp - End of the current period that the 
      subscription has been invoiced for. At the end of this period, a 
      new invoice will be created.
  - `current_period_start` - timestamp - Start of the current period that 
      the subscription has been invoiced for
  - `discount` - hash, discount object - Describes the current discount 
      applied to this subscription, if there is one. When billing, a 
      discount applied to a subscription overrides a discount applied on 
      a customer-wide basis.
  - `ended_at` - timestamp - If the subscription has ended (either 
      because it was canceled or because the customer was switched to a 
      subscription to a new plan), the date the subscription ended
  - `trial_end` - timestamp - If the subscription has a trial, the end of 
      that trial.
  - `trial_start` - timestamp - If the subscription has a trial, the 
      beginning of that trial.
